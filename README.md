# PICO-football-display
A small programme for the RP2040 (original PICO board) to make a model of a football stadium display. It is tailored for the WorldCup 2022. Two teams can be chosen to play agains each other. The goals can be entered. A timer counts backward the time and forward the extra time. The time can be accelerated (for Kids with less patience when playing). 

Teams are chosen from their groups. Teams are represented by the flag of the country. 

All results can be entered and they are stored in the flash so that after the worldcup there is a complete database of the results.
